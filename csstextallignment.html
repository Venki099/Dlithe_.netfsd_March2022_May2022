      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing
      the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as
      HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside
      HTML and JavaScript.[2] CSS is designed to enable the separation of
      presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This
      separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and
      control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable
      multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a
      separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the
      structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the
      page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
      Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the
      same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such
      as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen
      reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for
      alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4] The
      name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which
      style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element.
      This cascading priority scheme is predictable. The CSS specifications are
      maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type
      (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March
      1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS
      documents.[5] In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use
      of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.

      In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that
      I've been turning over in my mind ever since. 'Whenever you feel like
      criticizing anyone,' he told me, 'just remember that all the people in
      this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.'
